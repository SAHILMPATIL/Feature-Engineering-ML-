# Feature-Engineering-ML-

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks focusing on essential feature engineering techniques for machine learning projects.

## Overview

This repository contains hands-on examples and guides for the most commonly used feature engineering processes in data science and machine learning, including:

- Handling missing values
- Handling outliers
- Managing imbalanced data
- Nominal (One-hot) encoding
- Target-guided ordinal encoding
